# FPGA and VLSI
A collection of designs for FPGA's at RTL level as well as transistor level with Cadence Virtuoso.

Assignments 1-4 describe designs at RTL and behavioral levels using Verilog for an FPGA. 
Assignments 5- describe designs at CMOS level using Cadence Virtuoso.

Some notable highlights:
- Variable Width Array Multiplier in Verilog and Integrated Circuit
- 8-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) in CMOS Layout
